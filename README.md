# Overview
A new React-based Google Books Search app. This app requires the user to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

## Starting the app locally
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder. After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. You can now search for your book of choice using the search engine and save any book that seems interesting to you!
